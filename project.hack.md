# Semaphore Integration into the Mina Protocol

## Project Background
Semaphore is a zero-knowledge protocol allowing users to prove group membership and send signals anonymously without revealing their identities. This project aims to integrate Semaphore into the Mina Protocol, utilizing Mina's blockchain to provide privacy features for zkApps.

## Proposal Overview

- **Problem:** Mina Protocol currently lacks native support for anonymous signaling and group membership proofs, limiting the development of privacy-focused applications.
- **Solution:** Integrate Semaphore into Mina by:
  - Developing compatible zk-SNARK circuits.
  - Building a smart contract in o1js for group and signal management.
  - Providing comprehensive documentation.
  - Developing an example application to demonstrate functionality.
- **Impact:** This integration will enhance privacy features in the Mina ecosystem, encourage developer adoption, and enable new applications that require anonymity. It will also strengthen Mina's position as a privacy-focused platform.
- **Audience:** Mina Protocol developers and those interested in building privacy-preserving applications on Mina.

## Architecture & Design

- **Detailed Design/Architecture:** 
  - **Semaphore Protocol Overview:**
    Semaphore is a zero-knowledge protocol that allows users to prove they belong to a group and send anonymous signals without revealing their identity. It uses zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) to provide privacy-preserving group membership proofs and anonymous signaling.
    
    - **Group Membership:** Usersâ€™ identities are cryptographically committed and stored in a Merkle Tree. Users can prove group membership without revealing their identity.
    - **Anonymous Signaling:** Users generate zk-SNARK proofs to send anonymous messages, with no link to their identity.
    - **Nullifier:** Ensures that users can only signal once by generating a unique cryptographic nullifier, preventing double-signaling while maintaining anonymity.

  - **Zero-Knowledge Circuits:** Implement Semaphore's zk-SNARK circuits optimized for Mina.
  - **Smart Contract (zkApps):** Deploy a smart contract for group management, signal verification, and nullifier handling, including appropriate testing.
  - **Example Application:** Create a simple testing app to demonstrate a use case for the integrated system.
- **Vision:** Establish a robust privacy layer within Mina, empowering developers to build applications with strong privacy guarantees and expanding the ecosystem's use cases.
- **Existing Work:** A prototype has already been developed. GitHub Repository: [https://github.com/dsilberschmidt/semaphore](https://github.com/dsilberschmidt/semaphore)
- **Production Timeline:** Expected to be production-ready within three months from the start date.
